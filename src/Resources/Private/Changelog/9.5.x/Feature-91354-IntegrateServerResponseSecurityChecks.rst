Feature: #91354 - Integrate server response security checks
===========================================================

See :issue:`91354`

Description
===========

In order to evaluate potential server misconfigurations and to reduce
the potential of security implications in general, a new HTTP response
check is integrated to "Environment Status" and the "Security" section
in the reports module.


Impact
======

It is evaluated whether non-standard file extensions lead to unexpected
handling on the server-side, such as `test.php.wrong` being evaluated
as PHP or `test.html.wrong` being served with `text/html` content type.

Details are explained in `TYPO3 Security Guidelines for Administrators`_.
